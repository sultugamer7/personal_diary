# personal_diary

This is my final project for CS50. It's a web app named Personal Diary. It helps us to maintain a personal diary of our own, but without actually using a book. The user can create and log into his/her account and start writing entires or pages in the diary. Once the user finishes writing a page, he/she can save it. Then the user can read any page that he/she has written previously. The user cannot write a page for the same date twice. The user also cannot edit a page once it's written. The user can also bookmark pages for accessing them later easily from the bookmarks page. The user can also change his/her password. The user can also delete his/her account. Once the user deletes his/her account, he/she ends up tearing all the pages from his/her diary (i.e. the pages are deleted).
